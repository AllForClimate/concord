# Welcome to Concord! 

Any form of contribution is highly appreciated. We're building Concord to enable communities to operate as a DAO, so we put a lot of effort into making the UX as pleasant as possible, especially for non-crypto users.

`develop` is the default branch.

- Browse the current [open issues](https://github.com/AllForClimate/concord/issues), maybe you have the skills to help us fix one them! You can also work on any feature that you find relevant to add.
- Fork [our repo](https://github.com/AllForClimate/concord) and do your best.
- Make your pull request, weâ€™ll be happy to review it! 
 
We will manually check if:
- the bot works,
- the frontend works,
- all Solidity tests pass.

Feel very free to join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/uSxzJp3J76) if you want to make suggestions or request a specific feature.
