# Kiez DAO

A new form of DAO.

## Motivation

The idea is to give citizens an easy way to create a DAO for their neighborhood. So that they can start rebuilding local resilience, reclaim empty spaces, manage commons, organize. 

## Install

```
cd concord
npm i
```

## Test

```
npx hardhat test
```

## Run

```
cd frontend
yarn start
```

## User workflow

- I join a Discord server
- The admins make me a member (a specific Discord role)
- I have access to the vote channel
- I get myself an Ethereum address (using [Torus Discord login](https://app.tor.us/) or any)
- I declare my Ethereum address
- I submit a proposal (I need to show invoices, proofs, etc) asking for an amount labelled in MATIC
- The other members vote (adding a `thumb up` emoji)
- I get the money in cash

## Set up

- Deploy an instance of Concord.sol
- Add the bot your Discord server
