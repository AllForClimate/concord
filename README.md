# Kiez DAO

A new form of DAO.

## Motivation

The idea is to give citizens an easy way to create a DAO for their neighborhood. So that they can start rebuilding local resilience, reclaim empty spaces, manage commons, organize.

## User workflow

- I join a Discord server
- The admins make me a member (a specific Discord role)
- I have access to the vote channel
- I get myself an Ethereum address (using [Torus Discord login](https://app.tor.us/) or any)
- I declare my Ethereum address

#### Submit a proposal

- I submit a proposal asking for an amount labelled in MATIC
- The other members vote (adding a `thumb up` emoji)
- I get the money in cash (MATIC)

#### Claim 

- I claim a task that I performed
- The other members vote (adding a `thumb up` emoji)
- I get the requested amount of tokens

- As a member, I can tip another user in Discord
- As a non-member, I first need to topup my account
